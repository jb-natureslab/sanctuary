These grants will be used to support churches and individuals understand the government scheme, discern if they will sponsor a refugee and to navigate the process if they choose to proceed.\n \nThe Sanctuary Foundation is a partnership between registered charities, churches and other agencies led by Dr Krish Kandiah\n \nPlease join Krish on this journey to make the UK a sanctuary for those fleeing injustice and war.\n\nPlease email (link: mailto:hello@sanctuaryfoundation.org.uk text: hello@sanctuaryfoundation.org.uk) for more information.\n\n### Reset\n\n(link: https:\/\/resetuk.org\/ text: Reset) works to support and train friends, colleagues and neighbours to welcome refugees to their neighbourhoods. It was set up in 2018 to coordinate the  growth of the community sponsorship movement across the UK to ensure it realises its full, transformative potential.  Reset trains all groups that are approved by the Home Office, and offers support from planning an application through their integration. In 2021, Reset started working with friends and neighbours to provide integration support to people who have been displaced from their homes and who are able to come to the UK through skilled worker visas.  Reset offers expert training, advice and support to those who welcome refugees.\n\n>\"Watching the situation in Ukraine unfold is devastating. Here at Reset we're receiving a huge number of enquiries from people across the UK desperate to find ways in which they can help and it's why we're so pleased that a humanitarian sponsorship programme will be launched. We know that friends, neighbours, businesses and communities want to offer welcome, and as we await the programme to begin we want to make sure we can all move as quickly as possible to offer safety and welcome\" - Kate Brown, Co-Director\n\n![Reset Communities and Refugees](\/assets\/images\/reset.jpg)\n\n### Stewardship\n\n(link: https:\/\/www.stewardship.org.uk\/ text: Stewardship) helps to unite Christians to release generous gifts and financial support to Christian ministries in the UK and overseas.
