				<blockquote>&ldquo;It is easy to feel helpless and hopeless watching the plight of Ukrainians as their lives are devastated and as so many flee in search of refuge. But we CAN be proactive - we can get ready to provide welcome, support and community for those who make it to the UK. I signed up to the Sanctuary Foundation as soon as registration opened. It means I am on the list to meet refugees at the airport, and pledge to befriend and help a family. It also means the Government knows there are huge numbers of us wanting to be a blessing to refugees - we are poised and ready to help. Can I encourage you to sign up too?&rdquo;</blockquote>
