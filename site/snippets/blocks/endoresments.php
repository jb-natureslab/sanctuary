				<blockquote>&ldquo;As we watch the human tragedy of the war in Ukraine unfold, the people of Britain want to play our part, with many hundreds of people and groups already pledging to help welcome Ukrainian refugees to Britain. When the government opens the humanitarian routes to make that possible, we all have an enormous opportunity to untap and expand this wave of civic energy right across Britain. Everyone who wants to make welcoming work, for those given sanctuary in Britain and the communities they join, is invited to be part of this historic effort.&rdquo;</blockquote>

				<blockquote>&ldquo;I'm hugely grateful to this country for accepting my family when they were refugees. It's just one of many reasons I feel passionately that we should do everything we can to accept those fleeing war and persecution. The church should be at the forefront of welcoming refugees, regardless of their faith or beliefs, putting our faith into action and showing the love of God to those who have lost everything.&rdquo;</blockquote>

				<blockquote>&ldquo;It is easy to feel helpless and hopeless watching the plight of Ukrainians as their lives are devastated and as so many flee in search of refuge. But we CAN be proactive - we can get ready to provide welcome, support and community for those who make it to the UK. I signed up to the Sanctuary Foundation as soon as registration opened. It means I am on the list to meet refugees at the airport, and pledge to befriend and help a family. It also means the Government knows there are huge numbers of us wanting to be a blessing to refugees - we are poised and ready to help. Can I encourage you to sign up too?&rdquo;</blockquote>
